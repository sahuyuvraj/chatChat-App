# React Firebase chatChat by Yuvraj 

A fullstack chat demo with React JS and Firebase. 
used a security logic so that user can't say any terrible things and try to break the auth by spamming with lot's of messages or try to volatile community guidelines,but most imortant task is how to authenticate user to firebase and how to work with real time data in firebase.
It is like single room chat room where anybody can chat.User must log in using google account.Once logged in they can post messages into the chat.
